# Song Recommendations
Given a playlist curated from the [MillionSongDataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/), give 5 song recommendations that are similar to the playlist.
A subset of 10,000 random songs were taken from the dataset to be used in our analysis.

## How to run it!
Using the subset of data that we have provided, two methods can be used to see our analysis:

### Using Python Virtual Environments (Python 3.5+)

Create a virtual environment and cd in

`python3 -m venv <name_of_venv>`

`cd <name_of_venv>`

Activate the venv which changes your paths

`source ./bin/activate`

Clone the repository and cd in

`git clone git@csil-git1.cs.surrey.sfu.ca:bvtrinh/353-project.git`

`cd 353-project`

Install requirements

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Afterwards run the Juputer Notebook

`jupyter-notebook`

Open the index.ipynb for song recommendations!
